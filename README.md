# Responsive-Portfolio

This repository is an on-going reflection of my personal portfolio. the home page shares a bio of me along with a picture. It was one of my first projects that I created as a new Developer. It showcases the different projects I have worked on since starting my Programming career. The different projects can be found in the Portfolio tab. The portfolio also contains a contact form in which others can contact me.
